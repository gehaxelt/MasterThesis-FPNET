FPMON - Fingerprinting Monitor
=================
This is a tool developed by [Felix Kybranz as part of his master thesis](https://github.com/KybranzF/Master-Thesis/). The original version can be checked out [from his repository here](https://github.com/KybranzF/fpmon).

In order to use FPMON with FPNET, some modifications were necessary, which are not public yet. If you need these changes, please reach out to us. Otherwise, clone the modified FPMON version into this directory.
